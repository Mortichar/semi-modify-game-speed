# This is SEMI v0.3.2 for Chrome.

The main difference is in manifest.json, which doesn't include the browser_specific_settings section that throws errors when loading the extension into Chrome.

If you're installing SEMI into Chrome, this is a convenient subdirectory to download and install SEMI from.

Copied from main README:

#### Chrome Developer Install

Open settings > tools > extensions, enable developer options in the top right, and click "Load Unpacked" on the left. Open the folder that contains manifest.json to load the add-on. It will be inside subfolders after extracting, so make sure you select the 'chrome' folder which contains manifest.json.
