### It's a Firefox and Chrome browser extension for the fun idle web game Melvor Idle. 
This add-on/extension helps you automate certain aspects of the game, and adds certain useful features, combining many scripts into one. Toggle each one on and off individually from inside the game.

* AutoBonfire by Dream
* Auto Mine & Auto Sell Gems by Strutty & others
* AutoSlayer by Bubbalova: automates Slayer tasks, optionally automatically equips mirror shield or magic ring.
* AutoCombat: eat food and loot automatically, exit combat if you're out of food/ammo/runes.
* AutoCombat Options: Toggle auto eat and loot
* Calculate number of selected potions needed until next level button in Herblore page
* Thieving calculators and tooltips by RedSparr0w (scavenged from Melvor Idle Helper)
* Auto-cook: permanently unlocked Cook All button in the Cooking skill page
* XHP script by Breakit

Added in 0.1.1:
* AutoCook by Unicue
* AutoFish by BreakIt, Jarx, and Myself with added options: Max Mode (for use with fishing potions) and Chase Chests (fish treasure chests when spawned)
* UI updates & more menu toggles, even for native Melvor sidebar sections like Other & Socials

Added in 0.1.2:
* Tweaked AutoMine to only switch if the current mining action is complete (more efficient)


*When Melvor Idle updates to Alpha v0.13:*
* From Discord: ["Confirmed Minor Additions / Cooking is Idle from the start"](https://discordapp.com/channels/625838709203271680/670966404433969172/670969351821590558)
    * AutoCook extra button is obsolete, and should be deleted.

### Goal of the Software
This software was made to unify many Melvor automation and QOL scripts, including my own, into one easy-to-use platform with a UI that mirrors the game, without worrying about compatibility or maintaining individual userscripts.

This was built around Melvor Idle alpha v0.12.2.
