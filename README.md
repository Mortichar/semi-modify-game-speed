This is Melvor Idle Cheat Engine version 0.1.1, a Firefox browser extension for the fun idle web game Melvor Idle. It helps you cheat and such, doing these things so far:
* Add gold
* Add loot
* Level up a skill
* Auto-combat: eat food and loot automatically
* Helps you become a dirty nasty rotten cheater and ruin the game a little bit

Download it here at the Mozilla addon database: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/melvor-idle-cheat-engine/

Or download the source code, open the url "about:debugging" without quotes, and install the addon by opening either manifest.json or MICE.js in the folder.

Things that are possible and soon to be worked on:
* Add mastery
* Better UI/menu for Adding Loot Cheat
* Stop combat when out of food, arrows, or runes with Autocombat
* Autocook/fire unlock
* Unlimited name changes
* Export save unencrypted
* &more

Will the creator patch it up? Who knows.
