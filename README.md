This is Melvor Idle Cheat Engine version 0.1.1, a Firefox browser extension for the fun idle web game Melvor Idle. It helps you cheat and such, doing these things so far:
    - Add gold
    - Add loot
    - Level up a skill
    - Auto-combat: eat food and loot automatically
    - Helps you become a dirty nasty rotten cheater and ruin the game a little bit
Things that are possible and soon to be worked on:
    - Add mastery
    - Better UI/menu for Adding Loot Cheat
    - Stop combat when out of food, arrows, or runes with Autocombat
    - Autocook/fire unlock
    - Unlimited name changes
    - Export save unencrypted
    - &more

Will the creator patch it up? Who knows.
