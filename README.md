This is Melvor Idle Cheat Engine version 0.2.2, a Firefox browser extension for the fun idle web game Melvor Idle. It helps you cheat and such, doing these things so far:
* Add gold
* Add loot
* Level up a skill
* Auto-combat: eat food and loot automatically, exit combat if you're out of food/ammo/runes.
* Auto-cook: permanently unlocked Cook All button in the Cooking skill page
* Change your name without limits using the cheat menu
* Ability to unlock the banner ad setting in the regular settings menu without skill at 99, still enabled by default because those ads support the dev!
* List of all Loot IDs and names to use the loot cheats
* Helps you become a dirty nasty rotten cheater and ruin the game a little bit

Added in MICEv0.2.3:
* Instantly grow your crops, herbs, or trees with new buttons in the farming page
* Instantly attack your enemies without limits with a savage, dirty button in the combat page

Or download the source code, open the url "about:debugging" without quotes, and install the addon by opening either manifest.json or MICE.js in the folder.

Things that are possible:
* Add mastery, but now that mastery coins have been added to the game, not as relevant
* Better UI/menu for Adding Loot Cheat
* Export save unencrypted
* &more

Will the creator patch it up? Who knows.
MICEv0.2.2 was built around Melvor Idle alpha v0.12. MICEv0.2.3 is built around Melvor v0.12.2.
