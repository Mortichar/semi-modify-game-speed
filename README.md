### It's a Firefox & Chrome browser extension for the fun idle web game Melvor Idle. It helps you cheat and such, doing these things so far:
* Add gold
* Add loot
* Level up a skill
* Auto-combat: eat food and loot automatically, exit combat if you're out of food/ammo/runes.
* Auto-cook: permanently unlocked Cook All button in the Cooking skill page
* Change your name without limits using the cheat menu
* Ability to unlock the banner ad setting in the regular settings menu without skill at 99, still enabled by default because those ads support the dev!
* List of all Loot IDs and names to use the loot cheats
* Helps you become a dirty nasty rotten cheater and ruin the game a little bit

#### Added in MICEv0.2.3:
* Instantly grow your crops, herbs, or trees with new buttons in the farming page
* Instantly attack your enemies without limits with a savage, dirty button in the combat page

#### Added in MICEv0.3: 
* UI Changes: info section in cheat menu, hints in tooltips, custom modals, custom notifications, less intrusive overall
* Add Slayer Coins cheat
* AutoSlayer script by Bubbalova
* XPH script by Breakit
* AutoCombat Options: Toggle auto eat and loot
* Calculate number of selected potions needed until next level button in Herblore page
* Coming soon: cheat-free extension SEMI, or Scripting Engine for Melvor Idle. No cheats, all automation scripts.

#### Added in 0.3.1:
* Chrome support! Web store availability soon
* Cheat menu is now black background by default to prevent light theme eye strain
* Cheat menu info and loot list formatted a little better
* If Auto-Eat is off and AutoCombat is running, it will no longer terminate auto combat when out of food. 
* Another wacky button in the combat page for automatically attackin' faster than normal. Jeeze, pardner, slow down!

Will the creator patch it up? Who knows.
MICEv0.3.1 is built around Melvor v0.12.2.
