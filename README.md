### Goal of the Software
This software was made to unify many Melvor automation and QOL scripts, including my own, into one easy-to-use platform with a UI that mirrors the game, without worrying about compatibility or maintaining individual userscripts.

This was built around Melvor Idle alpha v0.12.2.
