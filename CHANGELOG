Scripting Engine for Melvor Idle Changelog

v0.3.1

* AutoSmith Bars: New skill automation that will cycle through your smeltable bars and smelt them all.
* UI Changes: 
    * Katorone settings menu moved to AutoSkills section
    * AutoSkills rearranged
* Small fixes
    * When using AutoCombat in dungeons with ranged, attempting to autoequip arrows would cause a broken loop.
    * AutoCombat automatically equipping arrows no longer reports equipping Normal Logs when at 0 arrows.
    * When canceling AutoCook, will stop cooking immediately.
    * AutoSlayer will no longer skip Slayer tasks when you are properly equipped for a slayer zone and AS Auto Equip is disabled.
* Repository changes
    * Moved extension code to source subdirectory
    * Created changelog to clean up the readme

## v0.3
* Seems to be working on android Firefox. Might as well open it up to that platform as well. **Best displayed in landscape view.**
    * **Note for Chrome users**: this version will throw a harmless error when loading into Chrome because Chrome does not recognize a part of the manifest.json necessary to run the extension on Firefox for Android. If you want to get rid of the error, delete the "browser_specific_settings" section in manifest.json. Deleting lines 13-17 of manifest.json will give you a perfectly fine Chrome version. See [Temporary install](https://gitlab.com/aldousWatts/SEMI#temporary-install) below for installation.

### Additions:
* GUI for XPH for every skill. Get crunchy with your XP per hour calculations nicely displayed in-game, no console needed. Also calculates time until desired level.
* GUI for AutoMine Bar Selection: with priority override and smithing bar selection, there are plenty of ways to customize AutoMine to your needs without using the console.
* Barf my potion button: Removes your currently equipped potion on the current page. Handy for chasing down fishing chests when you just drank a fisherman's potion!
* AutoCombat will now attempt to re-equip 1000 of your currently equipped arrows from your bank if your quiver has less than 500, and will still exit combat if you run out completely.

### Fixes:
* AutoSlayer was a little broken after combat was updated in Melvor v0.13, but now seems to run fine. 
    * Was ignoring equipment requirements for slayer zones. Changed code to fix this.
    * Was throwing a dungeon complete screen every kill if you had just finished a dungeon then used AutoSlayer. Added a line to fix.
    * Was not re-equipping items after leaving slayer zones where they were required. Fixed.
    
v0.2.3.1:
* Some Katorone Automation edits that I did caused an issue with reserve gold and selling gems to pay for glove charges. This hotfix takes care of that issue: Katorone will now sell gems to boost the GP pool past the reserve amount in order to buy gem glove charges, thereby fixing the automation. Previously, it would not sell gems if you were at your reserve gold amount, and could not buy gem glove charges as a result.
* Minor UI updates

v0.2.3:
* AutoSell Gems was broken by the updated getBankQty function, reverted back, the script works again.
* Removed AutoCook extra button as Cooking is now idle from the start in alpha v0.13
* Fixed AutoCook script to work in alpha v0.13
* AutoEat script is now usable outside of combat, useful for thieving (suggested by Pentharian)
* Destroy All Crops button added to the Farming page: will remove all your plants in the currently selected farming area (suggested & prototyped by Jarx)
* Chase Crabs option for AutoFishing: will hunt down crabs for fishing potions. If using potions, will only hunt them if they are max in an area. Otherwise, will prioritize them after chests. (suggested by Jarx)

v0.2.2:
* AutoEat will now cycle through equipped foods before exiting combat (credit rebelEpik)
* getBankQty function updated for efficiency (credit rebelEpik)
* AutoReplant disabled by default (suggested by Rickardo)
* AutoFish is now fully automated: it will find max XP fish and stop chasing chests when using fishing potions.
* 0.2.2.1: quick fix to make sure AutoFish is hidden when Auto Skills visibility is toggled
* 0.2.2.2: quick fix to make sure AutoReplant is ACTUALLY off when starting SEMI.

v0.2.1:
* Quick fixes & mods to the Katorone scripts by rebelEpik & me:
    * Auto buy gem glove charges now respects the bank gp limit
    * AutoReplant respects the bank gp limit when Katorone is enabled and won't buy compost unless it has more than the reserve
    
v0.2:
* Huge update: incorporated many functions from Katorone's automation script into SEMI complete with a settings menu.
* Tweaked AutoMine to only switch if the current mining action is complete (more efficient)
* Added AutoMine priority override buttons, allows you to select one ore to prioritize above all others (still seeks highest XP)

v0.1.1:
* AutoCook by Unicue (cycles through fish and cooks in order)
* AutoFish by BreakIt, Jarx, and Myself with added options: Max Mode (for use with fishing potions) and Chase Chests (fish treasure chests when spawned)
* UI updates & more menu toggles, even for native Melvor sidebar sections like Other & Socials
