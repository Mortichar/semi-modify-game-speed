    * Reflected damage (Air god dungeon)
    * Stun damage increase (Water & Earth god dungeons)
    * Detects what attack is incoming and eats accordingly
    * Thanks to Lamb on the discord for letting me use some of their auto-eat script: https://pastebin.com/Fw4R7zv5

v0.3.8.1
Hotfix for the hotfix: now properly calculates enemy special attack damage.

v0.3.8
Auto-eat & auto-run hotfix: now calculates stun damage multipliers.
Removed Auto-Fortune, event over!

v0.3.7
Fixes, Android UI improvements, & Event Things

* Code & Utilities

    * Small fix to Android version: stop drag-menus from loading so that you can navigate the sidebar without a problem.
* UI updates
    * All SEMI in-game notifications should now appear over every other element in the page, including auto-sell GUI. This lets you see SEMI auto-sell notifications immediately after enabling.
    * Android game header buttons (including XPH GUI dropdown button & menu) have had margins reduced to prevent UI bugging on portrait mode.
* New scripts
    * AutoFortune: open them chests, baby!
* Script updates
    * AutoEat: back to more efficient, unless fighting a big boss. Now relies on max hit for eating calculations.
    * AutoRun: you're now properly scared of monsters that can kill you in one hit and you'll run away if that's the case.

v0.3.6
Holy Moly! Where to begin?
Massive code changes, big additions, lots of changes.
Huge thanks to DanielRX for the refactoring and additions! A huge part of the update is his fine work!

* Code & Utilities
    * SEMI can now save and load configurations from localstorage
    * Many added utility functions and core changes, almost every script has been updated and improved
    * Custom SEMI stylesheet, mainly used for the drag & lock menus for now
* UI updates
    * Drag-able menus!
        * Locks next to nav-bar section headings allow dragging.
        * Re-order and hide individual elements on the sidebar!
        * The order (and hidden states) are saved across refreshes!
* New scripts
    * Based on functions of Katorone:
        * AutoSell! Select items you want a robot to sell automatically from a nice GUI based on your item log!
        * AutoOpen! A GUI for choosing which containers to automatically open!
        * AutoBury! GUI to select which bones/items you'd like to automatically bury!
    * AutoCombat has been broken up into components:
        * AutoRun: prevent dying when out of food, or wasting food when out of runes/ammo.
        * AutoEquip Ammo: attempts to equip 1000 of the same arrow from your bank when you run below 500 arrows.
* Script updates
    * AutoEat
        * Needs more work, but its primary function is now more like maintaining max HP at all times.
        * Eats much faster and will eat until max HP is reached.
    * AutoCook & AutoSmith Bars
        * More efficient: no longer cycle through fish or bars you don't have materials to cook/smelt.
    * Katorone Automation
        * Somewhat split out into components (see above), but some remain:
            * GP Reserve
            * Auto Buy Bank Space (and sell gems to cover costs)
                * Now respects GP reserve amount.
            * Auto Buy Gem Glove Charges (and sell gems to cover costs)
        * Settings now persist after refreshing! For now, still need to enable it after refresh like any other script.
* Many other subtle code changes that improve SEMI!

Thanks for your patience!

v0.3.5

* AutoMine Changes:
    * Bug fix: cloud loading was causing mining ore container to reload and remove priority override buttons. Automine now checks for this and will add AM buttons if they are deleted.
    * Bar Selection now automatically mines by ratio, meaning it will check your bank for amounts of ores and mine with bar-smelting requirements in mind.
        * For example: when Mithril bar is selected, script will mine until you have 4 times as much coal as mithril in the bank, and continue that pattern so that you are efficiently mining with smelting the particular bar in mind.

* Upcoming:
    * Level calculator from Herblore now universal & more functional, however not accurate yet:
        * A small menu is now present on each crafting skill (cooking, smithing, crafting, etc).
        * These menus calculate (read: estimate) how many of a selected item you'd need to make to get to a level of your choosing, and a time estimate.
        * Still to-do: make them automatically track gloves, burn percentage/mastery bonuses, etc.

v0.3.4

* Melvor Idle has updated to alpha v0.14.2!
    * New AutoSlayer option: skip tasks. Will skip certain monsters (master farmer, moist monster, black knight, mithril knight, rune knight). Future GUI/menu planned.
    * Added extra paragraph of information to Katorone menu explaining how the GP limit will affect AutoReplant, potentially causing empty plots since no compost bought.
    * Easter event! Throwing a script into SEMI to automate your flaps, chaps. Script courtesy of Zeal Iskander on Melvor discord.

v0.3.3

* Melvor Idle has updated to alpha v0.14.1!
    * It seems Percent Accuracy is now in the game, so the percent accuracy script has been removed from SEMI to prevent redundancy.
    * New script: AutoSell Fish Junk. This script will sell all that junk for you instantly and repeat every 10sec, notifying you when selling.
    * XPH Time to Selected Level change: level 99 limit removed, should be functional for virtual levels above level 99.
* Code changes: Gearing up to change how SEMI works under the hood.
    * Huge help from DanielRX: splitting inject.js into individual scripts/plugins, more ideas for code cleanup and functional programming.
* Repository changes: Yep, stuff moved around again.
    * No more chrome release subdirectory. Instead there is a chrome.manifest.json file to replace default if desired. See Readme
    * New subdirectory for all the scripts etc.
* Update on that cooking bug report mentioned below: Malcs seems to have fixed it! Woohoo!

v0.3.2

* Melvor Idle has updated to alpha v0.14!
    * AutoFish is completely broken with the Fishing overhaul. AutoFish removed for now, may not be necessary any longer. If it comes back it'll need major reworks.
    * I submitted a bug report to the developer about the Cooking page, how it doesn't update the number of current fish if you burned fish. So, if you burn your last fish using AutoCook, the script will not continue.
        * Use cooking gloves with this script to ensure it doesn't break
        * If the bug isn't fixed soon I'll get to work rewriting the script to not rely on this buggy UI element
* SEMI Fixes:
    * XPH for Fishing now works and doesn't break the entire XPH system.
    * AutoCook was broken after the Cooking UI updated, fixed.
    * Not sure when a code typo slipped in for the Destroy All Crops button, but it's fixed.
* Updated from Others:
    * Arcanus: Added AutoReplant functionality for the Weird Goop update addition


v0.3.1

* AutoSmith Bars: New skill automation that will cycle through your smeltable bars and smelt them all.
* UI Changes:
    * Katorone settings menu moved to AutoSkills section
    * AutoSkills rearranged
* Small fixes
    * When using AutoCombat in dungeons with ranged, attempting to autoequip arrows would cause a broken loop.
    * AutoCombat automatically equipping arrows no longer reports equipping Normal Logs when at 0 arrows.
    * When canceling AutoCook, will stop cooking immediately.
    * AutoSlayer will no longer skip Slayer tasks when you are properly equipped for a slayer zone and AS Auto Equip is disabled.
* Repository changes
    * Moved extension code to source subdirectory
    * Created changelog to clean up the readme
    * Created chrome release version subdirectory for ez chrome installation without browser_specific_settings error

v0.3
* Seems to be working on android Firefox. Might as well open it up to that platform as well. **Best displayed in landscape view.**
    * Note for Chrome users: this version will throw a harmless error when loading into Chrome because Chrome does not recognize a part of the manifest.json necessary to run the extension on Firefox for Android. If you want to get rid of the error, delete the "browser_specific_settings" section in manifest.json. Deleting lines 13-17 of manifest.json will give you a perfectly fine Chrome version.
* Additions:
    * GUI for XPH for every skill. Get crunchy with your XP per hour calculations nicely displayed in-game, no console needed. Also calculates time until desired level.
    * GUI for AutoMine Bar Selection: with priority override and smithing bar selection, there are plenty of ways to customize AutoMine to your needs without using the console.
    * Barf my potion button: Removes your currently equipped potion on the current page. Handy for chasing down fishing chests when you just drank a fisherman's potion!
    * AutoCombat will now attempt to re-equip 1000 of your currently equipped arrows from your bank if your quiver has less than 500, and will still exit combat if you run out completely.
* Fixes:
    * AutoSlayer was a little broken after combat was updated in Melvor v0.13, but now seems to run fine.
        * Was ignoring equipment requirements for slayer zones. Changed code to fix this.
        * Was throwing a dungeon complete screen every kill if you had just finished a dungeon then used AutoSlayer. Added a line to fix.
        * Was not re-equipping items after leaving slayer zones where they were required. Fixed.

v0.2.3.1:
* Some Katorone Automation edits that I did caused an issue with reserve gold and selling gems to pay for glove charges. This hotfix takes care of that issue: Katorone will now sell gems to boost the GP pool past the reserve amount in order to buy gem glove charges, thereby fixing the automation. Previously, it would not sell gems if you were at your reserve gold amount, and could not buy gem glove charges as a result.
* Minor UI updates

v0.2.3:
* AutoSell Gems was broken by the updated getBankQty function, reverted back, the script works again.
* Removed AutoCook extra button as Cooking is now idle from the start in alpha v0.13
* Fixed AutoCook script to work in alpha v0.13
* AutoEat script is now usable outside of combat, useful for thieving (suggested by Pentharian)
* Destroy All Crops button added to the Farming page: will remove all your plants in the currently selected farming area (suggested & prototyped by Jarx)
* Chase Crabs option for AutoFishing: will hunt down crabs for fishing potions. If using potions, will only hunt them if they are max in an area. Otherwise, will prioritize them after chests. (suggested by Jarx)

v0.2.2:
* AutoEat will now cycle through equipped foods before exiting combat (credit rebelEpik)
* getBankQty function updated for efficiency (credit rebelEpik)
* AutoReplant disabled by default (suggested by Rickardo)
* AutoFish is now fully automated: it will find max XP fish and stop chasing chests when using fishing potions.
* 0.2.2.1: quick fix to make sure AutoFish is hidden when Auto Skills visibility is toggled
* 0.2.2.2: quick fix to make sure AutoReplant is ACTUALLY off when starting SEMI.

v0.2.1:
* Quick fixes & mods to the Katorone scripts by rebelEpik & me:
    * Auto buy gem glove charges now respects the bank gp limit
    * AutoReplant respects the bank gp limit when Katorone is enabled and won't buy compost unless it has more than the reserve

v0.2:
* Huge update: incorporated many functions from Katorone's automation script into SEMI complete with a settings menu.
* Tweaked AutoMine to only switch if the current mining action is complete (more efficient)
* Added AutoMine priority override buttons, allows you to select one ore to prioritize above all others (still seeks highest XP)

v0.1.1:
* AutoCook by Unicue (cycles through fish and cooks in order)
* AutoFish by BreakIt, Jarx, and Myself with added options: Max Mode (for use with fishing potions) and Chase Chests (fish treasure chests when spawned)
* UI updates & more menu toggles, even for native Melvor sidebar sections like Other & Socials
